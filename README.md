# Algorithmic Trading Project

This project is a Python-based algorithmic trading project that analyzes and predicts future stock prices using machine learning models. It utilizes a variety of libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TA-Lib.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can analyze historical stock data, identify trends and patterns, and make predictions about future stock prices. By using machine learning algorithms, the project aims to provide a more accurate and efficient way of predicting future stock prices.

## Features
The project includes the following features:

- Data pre-processing: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for the machine learning models.
- Feature engineering: The data is analyzed to identify features that can be used to train the machine learning models.
- Model development: The project uses several machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to predict future stock prices.
- Model evaluation: The project evaluates the performance of the machine learning models using various metrics, including mean squared error, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.
- Trading simulation: The project simulates trading based on the predicted stock prices and evaluates the profitability of the trading strategy.
